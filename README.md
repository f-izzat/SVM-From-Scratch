# SVMpy
This code was written during the writing of my undergraduate thesis as a means to understand the inner details of Support Vector Machines. This includes a rough translation of the original  \epsilon -SVR and \nu -SVR based on the C source code (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)). It also includes an attempt at a re-write of the orignal C++ Online-SVR (http://onlinesvr.altervista.org/) 


Note: This should only be used as a educational tool as it was for me. The orginal `LIBSVM` or `sklearn`  should be used instead for actual cases.
