# SVMpy
This code was written during the writing of my undergraduate thesis as a means to understand the inner details of Support Vector Machines. This includes a rough translation of the original  \epsilon -SVR and \nu -SVR based on the C source code (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/))
Note: This should only be used as a educational tool as it was for me. The orginal `LIBSVM` or `sklearn`  should be used instead for actual cases.
